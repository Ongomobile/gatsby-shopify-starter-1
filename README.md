# Gatsby Headless Shopify

I always wanted to learn how Shopify works. So I did some reasearch and built my first store.
I really like the idea of going with a headless application.

## How I worked on this project

- I decided to go with Gastby on the front end
- For the backend I used Shopify GraphQl API
- Referenced the Shopify Docs and found a great tutorial
- Deployed to Netlify

## How to navigate this project

- The state is managed with the [context API](https://github.com/Ongomobile/gatsby-shopify-starter-1/tree/master/src/context)
- Responsive CSS using styled-components:[UI Components](https://github.com/Ongomobile/gatsby-shopify-starter-1/tree/master/src/components)
- Default product [template](https://github.com/Ongomobile/gatsby-shopify-starter-1/tree/master/src/templates/ProductTemplate)
